# MCC Programming - Java

## Overview

This repository serves as a reference for the programming courses I completed during my Java Programming I and Java Programming II classes. These courses took place between December 2020 and February 2021, and between February 2021 and May 2021, respectively.

## Class Structure

Java Programming I and Java Programming II, while similar in many aspects, presented distinct learning experiences. Java Programming I marked my initial exposure to programming, focusing on fundamental concepts and introducing Java ANT. Projects in this course were relatively small, concentrating on Command Line Interface Applications. In contrast, Java Programming II delved into more complex projects, including Graphical User Interface Application development using Swing. Both classes followed a similar weekly structure, with two class sessions per week, predominantly consisting of lectures. Weekly assignments gradually expanded in scope, culminating in a final project.

## MCC Structure

These courses were part of a specialized programming academy I enrolled in through my high school. The academy placed a strong emphasis on self-learning. While MCC operates on a quarterly schedule, the programming academy split courses over trimesters. Each trimester, I engaged in two courses covering different topics.

## Note

This repository doesn't encompass the complete list of projects I undertook during these classes but includes those I have saved on my local machine. Please note that these projects might not be the most recent versions, as version control system (VCS) usage was required, and most projects were stored on a GitLab account I no longer have access to.

The comprehensive list of courses I completed includes Computer Programming (in Python), Introduction to Information Technology, Web Page Creation (with CSS and HTML), Java Programming I, Java Programming II, Introduction to Internet Scripting (with JavaScript), Introduction to Database Design (with SQL), Mobile App Development (using Flutter and Dart), SQL Programming, C# Programming I, C# Programming II, and C++ Programming I. Among these courses, I was only able to retain Java and JavaScript projects.
